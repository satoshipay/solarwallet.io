      <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and
        sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of
        your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal

      <h1 id="cookies">Cookies</h1>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Our website uses cookies. A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and
            numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The
            identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the
            server.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies: a persistent cookie will be
            stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the
            user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the
            user session, when the web browser is closed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal
            information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained
            from cookies.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>We use session and persistent cookies on our website as well as the localStorage capabilities of
            your browser.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Blocking or deleting any or all cookies may have a negative impact upon the usability of our
            Services or may practically exclude you from using them completely.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
